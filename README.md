# PymolDesign: Protein sequence design on PyMOL

Design your protein for given backbone structure on PyMOL

# What's this?

Run protein MPNN on PyMOL and predict the structure by ESM API.

Design part was adapted from [ProteinMPNN@ColabDesign](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabDesign/tree/main/mpnn) by [@sokrypton](https://github.com/sokrypton) and his collaborators.

Structure prediction part was adapted from [PymolFold](https://github.com/JinyuanSun/PymolFold) by [@JinyuanSun](https://github.com/JinyuanSun)
